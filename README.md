# UGotTime
UGotTime is an Android App that was made in 2016. This project was made during CS-102 course in Bilkent University as a Group. In this app you can see your common time with your friends. This is a simple schedular for people to arrange their time more efficiently. You can plan your time with your friends and that way you can meet more frequently. In this repository only the java files are included. PHP and SQL files are excluded since we don't have a server anymore.
